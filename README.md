# paas-operator

A meta operator, built with [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io)/
`controller-runtime`, that fronts other operators' large CRDs with small,
opinionated ones of our own. Each vendor gets its own thin CRD under
`paas.example.com/v1alpha1` — currently `PostgresCluster` (for
[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io)), `ValkeyCluster` (for
[valkey-io/valkey-operator](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-operator)),
`GrafanaInstance` (for
[grafana/grafana-operator](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-operator)),
`MariaDBCluster` (for
[mariadb-operator](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator)),
`RabbitMQCluster` (for the [RabbitMQ Cluster
Operator](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator)), and
`PrometheusInstance` (for the [Prometheus
Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)) —
reconciled into a full vendor object, so consumers get a working
Postgres/Valkey/Grafana/MariaDB/RabbitMQ/Prometheus instance from ~10 lines
of YAML instead of having to understand the vendor's much larger spec.

## How it works

Every vendor integration follows the same shape: our own thin CRD, a mapping
onto the vendor's real object, and a controller. The mapping and controller
are split into a reusable engine plus a small per-vendor adapter, so adding a
type means writing the adapter, not another copy of the reconcile loop.

- `internal/reconciler/reconciler.go` — the shared engine
  (`GenericReconciler[T, PT]`) used by every vendor integration:
  finalizer-gated cleanup, idempotent Server-Side Apply of the vendor object,
  status-mirroring with a standard `Ready` condition, and event recording.
  It's generic over the paas CR type and driven by a small `Adapter`
  interface — this is the one place the actual CRUD/reconciliation logic
  lives.
- `internal/cnpg/cnpg.go`, `internal/valkey/valkey.go`,
  `internal/grafana/grafana.go`, `internal/mariadb/mariadb.go`,
  `internal/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.go`, and `internal/prometheus/prometheus.go` —
  one `Adapter` implementation per vendor object: the target
  `GroupVersionKind`, how to build the desired vendor object from our CR's
  spec, and how to read phase/readiness back out of its status. None of the
  vendors' Go API types or CRD schemas are vendored — we don't own those
  CRDs, and their schemas are large and version-specific (see
  `crd-cnpg-v1.30.0.yaml`, `crd-valkey-v0.6.0.yaml`,
  `crd-grafana-v5.25.0.yaml`, `crd-mariadb-operator-v26.6.0.yaml`,
  `crd-rabbitmq-cluster-operator-v2.22.5.yaml`, and
  `crd-prometheus-operator-v0.93.1.yaml` at the repo root). Instead the
  target is addressed purely through controller-runtime's dynamic client
  (`unstructured.Unstructured` + a `schema.GroupVersionKind`), and the
  desired object is built as a plain `map[string]any` applied via
  Server-Side Apply (`client.Patch(ctx, obj, client.Apply, ...)`). This keeps
  the operator decoupled from any one vendor version.
- `api/v1alpha1/postgrescluster_types.go` / `valkeycluster_types.go` /
  `grafanainstance_types.go` / `mariadbcluster_types.go` /
  `rabbitmqcluster_types.go` / `prometheusinstance_types.go` — our own CRDs,
  scaffolded and generated the normal kubebuilder way
  (`+kubebuilder:validation`/`+kubebuilder:printcolumn` markers,
  `controller-gen` for the CRD YAML and deepcopy code).
- `internal/controller/postgrescluster_controller.go` /
  `valkeycluster_controller.go` / `grafanainstance_controller.go` /
  `mariadbcluster_controller.go` / `rabbitmqcluster_controller.go` /
  `prometheusinstance_controller.go` — a few lines each: they just
  instantiate `GenericReconciler` with the matching adapter (`cnpg.Adapter{}`
  / `valkey.Adapter{}` / `grafana.Adapter{}` / `mariadb.Adapter{}` /
  `rabbitmq.Adapter{}` / `prometheus.Adapter{}`) and register it with the
  manager. RBAC markers for both our own CRD and the vendor's live here.
- One paas CR maps to exactly one same-named vendor object. On delete, the
  operator removes the vendor object before releasing its own finalizer, so
  e.g. `kubectl delete postgrescluster` also tears down the database.
- Status is refreshed by polling (15s while not ready, 5m once ready) rather
  than a push watch: `unstructured.Unstructured` isn't registered with the
  manager's scheme, so an `Owns()`-style watch isn't available the way it is
  for typed children. Wiring a raw `source.Kind` watch on the dynamic GVK
  would remove the poll delay, if it's ever worth the complexity.
- `internal/controller/testdata/crd/postgresql.cnpg.io_clusters.yaml`,
  `valkey.io_valkeyclusters.yaml`, `grafana.integreatly.org_grafanas.yaml`,
  `k8s.mariadb.com_mariadbs.yaml`, `rabbitmq.com_rabbitmqclusters.yaml`, and
  `monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml` are the real vendor CRDs, loaded
  into `envtest` so the controller tests validate the generated objects
  against each vendor's actual OpenAPI schema — not just against our own
  assumptions about its shape.

### Adding another vendor integration

1. `kubebuilder create api --group paas --version v1alpha1 --kind <Kind>` for
   the thin CRD, then trim `<Kind>Spec`/`<Kind>Status` to the handful of
   fields worth exposing (see Scope below).
2. Add `internal/<vendor>/<vendor>.go` implementing
   `reconciler.Adapter[paasv1alpha1.<Kind>, *paasv1alpha1.<Kind>]` — GVK,
   `BuildManifest`, `ExtractStatus`, `ApplyStatus` (see `internal/cnpg` or
   `internal/valkey` as a template).
3. Replace the scaffolded controller body with a thin wrapper that builds
   `reconciler.GenericReconciler[...]{Adapter: <vendor>.Adapter{}, ...}` (see
   `internal/controller/valkeycluster_controller.go`), and wire it up in
   `cmd/main.go`.
4. Drop the vendor's real CRD YAML into `internal/controller/testdata/crd/`
   for envtest, and `make manifests generate`.

Rust/`kube-rs` was evaluated for this (a parallel implementation lived in
`rust-koprs/`) and dropped: the unstructured-client + Server-Side Apply
approach that keeps this operator decoupled from vendor CRD versions is
available identically in kube-rs, so a second language bought nothing beyond
a second toolchain to maintain.

## Scope

Deliberately minimal, per type. `PostgresCluster` exposes `instances`,
`image`, `storage.size`, `storage.storageClass`, `database.name`,
`database.owner`, and optional `resources`; `ValkeyCluster` exposes `shards`,
`replicas`, `image`, `persistence.size`, `persistence.storageClass`, and
optional `resources`; `GrafanaInstance` exposes `version`, `replicas`, and
optional `persistence.size`/`persistence.storageClass` (no PVC is requested
when `persistence` is unset — Grafana runs with ephemeral storage);
`MariaDBCluster` exposes `replicas`, `image`, `storage.size`,
`storage.storageClass`, `database.name`, `database.owner`, and optional
`resources` (`replicas` > 1 also turns on Galera Cluster, mariadb-operator's
synchronous multi-primary replication); `RabbitMQCluster` exposes `replicas`,
`image`, `storage.size`, `storage.storageClass`, and optional `resources`
(no bootstrap-database equivalent — the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator always
creates a default vhost and user itself, writing credentials to a
`<name>-default-user` Secret it manages); `PrometheusInstance` exposes
`version`, `replicas`, `retention`, optional `storage.size`/
`storage.storageClass` (no PVC is requested when `storage` is unset —
Prometheus runs with ephemeral storage), optional `resources`, and optional
`ingress` (the Prometheus Operator creates no Service of its own for
Prometheus, so setting `ingress` also makes this operator create a
ClusterIP Service fronting it). All
`resources` fields reuse `corev1.ResourceRequirements` directly, except
`GrafanaInstance`, which doesn't expose one: the real field lives deep
inside `spec.deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[].resources` (keyed by
container name) rather than as a simple top-level object, so it was left out
of this first pass rather than guessing at the container name grafana-operator
expects. Everything else in the generated vendor object (CNPG's backups,
monitoring, affinity, pooling, superuser secret, etc.; Valkey's TLS, ACLs,
exporter, pod disruption budget, etc.; Grafana's ingress/route, SMTP,
plugins, jsonnet, service accounts, etc.; mariadb-operator's TLS,
replication (non-Galera), MaxScale, backups, etc.; the RabbitMQ Cluster
Operator's TLS, plugins, definitions import, affinity, etc.; the Prometheus
Operator's rule/scrape-config selectors, remote write, Alertmanager
discovery, affinity, etc.) is left at that vendor's own defaults. Extending
a mapping means adding a field to the CR's `*Spec` type in `api/v1alpha1/`,
running `make manifests generate`, and threading it through that vendor's
`BuildManifest` in `internal/<vendor>/`.

Notes on what's deliberately out of scope:
- valkey-operator also defines a `ValkeyNode` CRD, but it's explicitly
  internal to that operator ("users should not create ValkeyNodes directly"
  per its own CRD description) — this operator only targets `ValkeyCluster`.
- grafana-operator ships a large family of child CRDs (`GrafanaDashboard`,
  `GrafanaDataSource`, `GrafanaFolder`, `GrafanaAlertRuleGroup`, ...) that
  configure a running Grafana — this operator only targets `Grafana` itself
  (the actual instance), the same way it only targets CNPG's `Cluster` and
  not CNPG's `Pooler`/`Backup`.
- mariadb-operator also defines `Backup`/`Restore`/`Connection`/`Database`/
  `User`/`Grant`/`MaxScale` CRDs; this operator only targets `MariaDB`
  itself, the actual cluster.
- the Prometheus Operator also defines `Alertmanager`/`ThanosRuler`/
  `PrometheusAgent`/`ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor`/`Probe`/`PrometheusRule`
  CRDs; this operator only targets `Prometheus` itself, the actual server —
  `ServiceMonitor`/`PodMonitor` objects are expected to be created
  separately (e.g. by CNPG's or mariadb-operator's own `MonitoringSpec`) and
  are simply discovered via the empty selectors `BuildManifest` sets.

## Verified while building this

`go build`, `go vet`, `make manifests`/`generate` (regenerates CRD YAML +
deepcopy code via `controller-gen`), `make lint` (golangci-lint, 0 issues),
and `make test` (a real `envtest` API server, with our CRDs and CNPG's,
valkey-operator's, grafana-operator's, mariadb-operator's, the RabbitMQ
Cluster Operator's, and the Prometheus Operator's actual CRDs all loaded —
see above) all pass; all six controller tests exercise finalizer-add,
Server-Side Apply of the generated vendor object, and the status-mirroring
logic end to end. Not run: anything against a live cluster with CNPG,
valkey-operator, grafana-operator, mariadb-operator, the RabbitMQ Cluster
Operator, or the Prometheus Operator actually installed and reconciling —
do that before trusting this in anything real (the Grafana mapping in
particular is untested against a live grafana-operator: the
`deployment.spec.replicas` and `persistentVolumeClaim` paths are correct
per its CRD schema, but its actual reconciliation behavior hasn't been
exercised end to end; same caveat for `MariaDBCluster`/`RabbitMQCluster`/
`PrometheusInstance` against a live mariadb-operator/RabbitMQ Cluster
Operator/Prometheus Operator).

## Installing the Dependency Operators

paas-operator only ever talks to the vendor CRDs (CNPG's `Cluster`,
valkey-operator's `ValkeyCluster`, grafana-operator's `Grafana`,
mariadb-operator's `MariaDB`, the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator's
`RabbitmqCluster`, the Prometheus Operator's `Prometheus`) via Server-Side
Apply — it never installs the vendor operators themselves. Each one has to
be running in the cluster *before*
paas-operator can reconcile anything, otherwise `BuildManifest`'s
Server-Side Apply calls fail because the target CRD doesn't exist yet. Most
ship a Helm chart; the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator ships a plain manifest
instead (its own recommended install path). That's the preferred route for
each below.

Install order doesn't matter between them (none depend on each other) — just
make sure whichever ones you actually plan to create CRs for are up before
applying `config/samples/` or your own CRs.

### CloudNativePG (for `PostgresCluster`)

```sh
helm repo add cnpg https://cloudnative-pg.github.io/charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install cnpg cnpg/cloudnative-pg \
  -n cnpg-system --create-namespace
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n cnpg-system
kubectl get crd clusters.postgresql.cnpg.io
```

Manifest fallback (no Helm):

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/release-1.30/releases/cnpg-1.30.0.yaml
```

`crd-cnpg-v1.30.0.yaml` at the repo root is the CRD bundle this operator was
built and tested against — both routes above install the matching 1.30.0
release.

### valkey-operator (for `ValkeyCluster`)

```sh
helm repo add valkey https://valkey.io/valkey-helm
helm repo update
helm install valkey-operator valkey/valkey-operator \
  -n valkey-operator-system --create-namespace
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n valkey-operator-system
kubectl get crd valkeyclusters.valkey.io
```

Manifest fallback (no Helm): valkey-operator doesn't publish a bundled
`install.yaml`; deploy from source instead —
`kubectl apply -k github.com/valkey-io/valkey-operator/config/default?ref=v0.6.0`.
`crd-valkey-v0.6.0.yaml` at the repo root is the CRD this operator was built
and tested against — the Helm chart above installs the matching `v0.6.0`
appVersion.

### grafana-operator (for `GrafanaInstance`)

```sh
helm upgrade -i grafana-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/grafana/helm-charts/grafana-operator \
  --version 5.25.0 -n grafana-operator-system --create-namespace
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n grafana-operator-system
kubectl get crd grafanas.grafana.integreatly.org
```

Manifest fallback (no Helm): see the [grafana-operator Kustomize
guide](https://grafana.github.io/grafana-operator/docs/installation/kustomize/),
or `kubectl apply -k github.com/grafana/grafana-operator/config/default?ref=v5.25.0`.
`crd-grafana-v5.25.0.yaml` at the repo root is the CRD this operator was
built and tested against — the Helm chart above installs the matching
`5.25.0` version.

### mariadb-operator (for `MariaDBCluster`)

```sh
helm repo add mariadb-operator https://mariadb-operator.github.io/mariadb-operator
helm repo update
helm install mariadb-operator-crds mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator-crds \
  --version 26.6.0
helm install mariadb-operator mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator \
  --version 26.6.0 -n mariadb-operator-system --create-namespace
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n mariadb-operator-system
kubectl get crd mariadbs.k8s.mariadb.com
```

Manifest fallback (no Helm): mariadb-operator doesn't publish a bundled
`install.yaml`; the Helm charts (also available as OCI images, see the
[Helm doc](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/main/docs/helm.md))
are the supported install path. `crd-mariadb-operator-v26.6.0.yaml` at the
repo root is the CRD this operator was built and tested against — the Helm
charts above install the matching `26.6.0` release.

### RabbitMQ Cluster Operator (for `RabbitMQCluster`)

```sh
kubectl apply -f \
  https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/download/v2.22.5/cluster-operator.yml
```

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n rabbitmq-system
kubectl get crd rabbitmqclusters.rabbitmq.com
```

The RabbitMQ Cluster Operator doesn't publish an official Helm chart — the
manifest above (installing into its own `rabbitmq-system` namespace) is the
project's own recommended install path.
`crd-rabbitmq-cluster-operator-v2.22.5.yaml` at the repo root is the CRD
this operator was built and tested against — the manifest above installs
the matching `2.22.5` release.

### Prometheus Operator (for `PrometheusInstance`)

```sh
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install prometheus-operator prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --version 89.2.0 -n prometheus-operator-system --create-namespace \
  --set prometheus.enabled=false \
  --set alertmanager.enabled=false \
  --set grafana.enabled=false \
  --set kubeStateMetrics.enabled=false \
  --set nodeExporter.enabled=false
```

`kube-prometheus-stack` is the community-maintained chart for the
Prometheus Operator itself — there's no separate lean "operator-only"
chart — so the flags above turn off everything this operator doesn't need
(the stack's own default Prometheus/Alertmanager, Grafana, and the
exporters), leaving just the operator and its CRDs.

Verify:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n prometheus-operator-system
kubectl get crd prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com
```

Manifest fallback (no Helm):

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.93.1/bundle.yaml
```

`crd-prometheus-operator-v0.93.1.yaml` at the repo root is the CRD this
operator was built and tested against — both routes above install the
matching `0.93.1` release (`kube-prometheus-stack` `89.2.0` pins
`appVersion: v0.93.1`).

### Once the dependency operators are up

Install paas-operator's own CRDs and controller (see below), then the
samples in `config/samples/` — `paas_v1alpha1_postgrescluster.yaml`,
`paas_v1alpha1_valkeycluster.yaml`, `paas_v1alpha1_grafanainstance.yaml`,
`paas_v1alpha1_mariadbcluster.yaml`, `paas_v1alpha1_rabbitmqcluster.yaml`,
`paas_v1alpha1_prometheusinstance.yaml` — double as a smoke test that each
dependency operator is reachable and correctly versioned.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.6+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.
- The dependency operators installed — see "Installing the Dependency
  Operators" above — for whichever CRs (`PostgresCluster`, `ValkeyCluster`,
  `GrafanaInstance`, `MariaDBCluster`, `RabbitMQCluster`,
  `PrometheusInstance`) you plan to create.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/paas-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/paas-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/paas-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/paas-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v2-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
